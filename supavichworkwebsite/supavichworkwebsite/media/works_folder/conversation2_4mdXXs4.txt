this is my plan if covid disappears within the next month. firstly, I will go to the beach with my friends and family
maybe to Huan Hin for about a week, then my next destination is taking my girlfriend shopping at Big C and take her 
on a lunch date in the shopping mall, 
in the evening time,I will be making a sandwich for my dinner

In the week time, I will be planning to buy my first-ever car, and use it to travel anywhere I want, for example, 
going to study at the library or go to Megabangna, then I will drive to find my girlfriend and take her to the most breath-taking, out of the world 
experience of her life as a present for our reunion and for celebrating the world without covid.
